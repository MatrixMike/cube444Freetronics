;; 16 April 2015
;; this is quite simple clojure code to generate tty input to the Freetronics Arduino Cube (4*4*4)
;; as a demo, to a mature student, about repeated commands, 3D co-ordinates etc
;; Mike Hewitt

;; note:  the append command needs to have an 'open' command before it will work
;; copy this into clojure REPL - it will generate a file of name 'cubefile' 
;; much can be done to tidy this but as it works it gets saved to the great git god
